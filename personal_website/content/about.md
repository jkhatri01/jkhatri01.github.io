*Hello World!*, I am **Jay Khatri**.

My almost past affair with cars made me an **Automobile Engineer**.

**BUT** my lungs worry about the taste of air that I and billions breathe and the looming catastrophe of climate change resulted in me completing MSc in Transport at [ITS](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport).

I am interested in **transport** + **environment** + **transport-justice** + **air-quality**.

Reach me at: j dot khatri zero one at gmail dot com
