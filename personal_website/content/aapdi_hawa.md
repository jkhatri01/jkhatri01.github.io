**Project Aapdi Hawa**(*English translation: Our Air*) is an effort to expand the debate of **worsening air** quality in **Indian cities** beyond the critically polluted cities with a focus on improving the skill set grassroots levels of the governance structure.

Currently, **202 operational CAAQMS** across Indian cities record air quality parameters. While this information-based policy instrument is a powerful tool, **lack of skill set of interpreting the data and visualizing complex interactions** deters us and city officials to use the data for various **urban planning decisions**.

By **making available crisp visualizations and reports** on air quality parameters recorded by CAAQMS across India, Aapdi Hawa tries to bridge this gap.

I believe it is crucial also to **develop actions from the grassroots level of governance** structure, **which NCAP fails to recognize** with a lack of efforts to improve the skill set of municipal and city officials empowering them. These empowered officials at the lowest levels of governance, **making more informed decisions** for various urban planning projects or putting interventions in place to **improve air quality at a spatial scale** of a city. Also, aid collaboration at a regional level with surrounding cities with data-based evidence to enhance the quality of air.
