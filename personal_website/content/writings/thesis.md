+++

This thesis analysis **short term** impact on **lung function** from **exposure to UFP (Ultrafine particles)** in kerbside and urban background conditions
simultaneously by undertaking bicycling as commute choice. UFP concentrations and breathing flow rates are measured **continiously in realtime** during bicycling.
Pre/post bicycling activity impact on lung function in terms of **spirometry** and change in **FeNO (Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide)**
